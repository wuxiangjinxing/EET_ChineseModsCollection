# EET_ChineseModsCollection
A collection of Chinese translations for EET mods (BG1EE + BGIIEE)

This is my collection/revision of the Chinese translation of some mods for the Baldur's Gate Trilogy enhanced edition.  The mods shall be available from EET Setup Tool at https://github.com/EE-Mod-Setup/EE-Mod-Setup.

Some translations are collected from other online resources (i.e. https://trow.cc/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make the installation through EET Setup Tool as stable as possible, I keep all the translations in the 'english' language folders (american, en_us, english, etc.).  All the translation files are encoded in UTF-8.
